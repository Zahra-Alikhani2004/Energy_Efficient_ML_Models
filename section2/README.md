## Abstract

This paper explores energy-efficient approaches in machine learning, collectively known as Green AI. The authors focus on optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search (NAS) to reduce computational costs and energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. The study demonstrates that applying these techniques can reduce power usage by approximately 40–70% without compromising model performance. It also highlights the significance of hardware-level optimization using energy-efficient processors such as TPUs, Jetson, and FPGAs, as well as energy monitoring tools like CodeCarbon to track carbon emissions during model training and deployment.
